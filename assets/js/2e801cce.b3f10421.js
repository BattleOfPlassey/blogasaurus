I create them, I work closely with a React Native development team and we develop iOS apps for internal business users. Also, I spend a lot of time on my phone. And I want to share my observations so you don\u2019t spend a lot of time and money building an app that doesn\u2019t advance your business goals (or may even hurt them).\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nLet\u2019s start with some challenges.\\n\\n### 1. A bad app damages your brand\\n\\nA cheap app performs poorly, feels bulky, and frustrates user every time they use it. **If you can\u2019t or won\u2019t spend the money to do it right, don\u2019t build a mobile app**.\\n\\n### 2. A not so useful app doesn\u2019t grow your brand\\n\\nLet\u2019s say you create an app, and while it is beautiful and easy to use, it\u2019s also useless. That sounds harsh. What I mean is, the functions it provides are not ones that users need or will want to take on their phone.\\n\\n**If you can\u2019t come up with a compelling use case that screams, \u201cYou gotta do this on a phone!\u201d, don\u2019t build a mobile app.**\\n\\n### 3. The competition is tough\\n\\nThe final question to answer before creating a mobile app is, \u201cWho is my competition?\u201d The answer is *not* the companies that are in your product market. The answer is *every other mobile app*. If someone is on another app, they\u2019re not in yours. So your competitors are Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Mail, Text, Maps and even the calendar app.\\n\\nThat\u2019s what you have to fight. If you\u2019re not the reason the user is pulling out their phone, then your app is never going to be opened, and eventually, it will get uninstalled.\\n\\n**If you can\u2019t come with a rock-solid reason why a user would choose to open your app instead of something else, don\u2019t build a mobile app.**\\n\\n### 4. The Road to Success is dark and full of (t)errors\\n\\nUsers make quick decisions about whether to keep an app on their phone or uninstall it w/o reason. The reasons range from (\u201cI didn\u2019t like the colours\u201d) to (\u201cIt crashed when I launched it\u201d) to (\u201cI don\u2019t get what it does\u201d ) and lastly (\\"There is too many ads\\").\\n\\nOnce a user has removed your app, that\u2019s the end of the road. No amount of new feature enhancements or fixes will bring them back: they\u2019re GONE.\\n\\n**If your plans don\u2019t include an approach for winning over users quickly, don\u2019t build a mobile app.**\\n\\nIn conclusion, Understand the challenges, question your assumptions vigilantly, and only build a mobile app if you can answer why you\u2019re building it, how your customers will use it, and why they\u2019ll want to launch it and love it."},{"id":"conformity-stifles-creativity","metadata":{"permalink":"/conformity-stifles-creativity","source":"@site/blog/2021-01-16-conformity-stifles-creativity.md","title":"Does conformity stifles creativity ?","description":"The extend to which conformity stifles creativity depends upon the nature of the job being executed, the temperament of each individual and the final goal to be achieved.

Whether conformity stifles individual energy depends on the individual person. Where teamwork is key, they function best in an environment where their role is well defined. For conformists , they share a common goal, purpose or mission with a group that must work together as cogs in a machine to achieve that mission. In the military or any sports, each individual is responsible to play and conform to group\u2019s common mission or goal. And rather than quelling energy, this conformity breeds camaraderie, as well as fervor and enthusiasm for winning a battle or the game. Besides, non-conformity in these situations only serves to undermine success; if game-plan or battle strategies were left to each individuals or participants, the results would be disastrous.\\n\\nConformist find enhanced energy in certain corners of the business world as well, particularly in traditional services like finance, retail, sales, accounting, insurance, legal-services and healthcare. In these business, iconoclasts find no place to revel and thrive but rather those individual who can work most effectively within the constraints of established practices, policies and regulations. Of course a clever idea or tactic might help turn tides during a meeting for structuring a deal, or a creative legal maneuver, might play a simple role in winning smaller battles along the way. But such tactics are of those conformists who are playing by the same ground rules as their peers.\\n\\nIn sharp contrast, other people are non-conformist by nature. These people are motivated by the personal satisfaction that comes with creativity, innovation and invention of novel ideas. For these individual, a highly structured and sophisticated bureaucratic environment only serves to quell motivation and energy. Artists and musicians even find these type of environments stifling and even noxious. Entrepreneurial business people who thrive on this innovation and differentiation often driven to self-employment because they feel stifled and frustrated, even offended, by the bureaucracy which requires conformity.\\n\\nAs for conformity stifling individual creativity, we need to look at another example. Our most creative people are highly eccentric in their personal appearance, lifestyle and so forth. In fact they seem to eschew any form of conformity, established norms and mores.   Lady Gaga known for her eccentric appearance at the renowned music award functions. Michael Jackson, most creative force in popular music culture is nothing if not non-conforming in every way. Besides, by definition creativity begs non-conformity. In other words, any creative act is necessary to be in non-conformance with what already exists.\\n\\nTo sum up, conformists find their energy by conforming and non-conformists by not conforming. And creativity is the exclusive domain of non-conformists."},{"id":"challenge-assertion","metadata":{"permalink":"/challenge-assertion","source":"@site/blog/2021-01-01-challenge-assertion.md","title":"Should students challenge the assertions of others?","description":"Questioning and challenging the assertions of others has proven to be effective in the process of learning","date":"2020-12-31T18:30:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 31, 2020","tags":[{"label":"conformity","permalink":"/tags/conformity"},{"label":"students","permalink":"/tags/students"},{"label":"learning","permalink":"/tags/learning"},{"label":"essay","permalink":"/tags/essay"},{"label":"gre","permalink":"/tags/gre"},{"label":"awa","permalink":"/tags/awa"}],"readingTime":2.405,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Palash Shrivastava","title":"Not a writer, Ssshhh!","url":"https://github.com/battleofplassey","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35087196?v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"challenge-assertion","title":"Should students challenge the assertions of others?","author":"Palash Shrivastava","author_title":"Not a writer, Ssshhh!","author_url":"https://github.com/battleofplassey","author_image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35087196?v=4","tags":["conformity","students","learning","essay","gre","awa"],"keywords":["students","conformity","essay","gre","awa"],"draft":false,"description":"Questioning and challenging the assertions of others has proven to be effective in the process of learning","hide_table_of_contents":false,"image":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35087196?v=4","date":"2020-12-31T18:30:00.000Z"},"prevItem":{"title":"Does conformity stifles creativity ?","permalink":"/conformity-stifles-creativity"},"nextItem":{"title":"Advancements in a field of study and outside experts","permalink":"/experts-newbie"}},"content":"Too much emphasis has been placed on the need for students to challenge the assertions of others. \x3c!--truncate--\x3eSome say social harmony should be the goal of every school. It is erroneous to place an overemphasis on either side as I believe that it is essential to promote a healthy balance between the two.\\n\\nAs we move away from traditional ways of learning, more students are being encouraged to raise questions and challenge the assertions of others in order to test and validate established facts as well as deepen their understanding of the subject matter. During older times, especially during the times when religious institutions were the primary source of education, students were taught to accept facts without questioning much, which led to a decay of the intellect, as proved in many instances in history.\\n\\nQuestioning and challenging the assertions of others has proven to be effective in the process of learning. Questioning is one of the oldest forms of learning. From the philosophical form of inquiry preached by Socrates to the intellectual revolution of the Renaissance era, it is very obvious that independent thought and ideas are essential for making new discoveries and progress, and schools should not promote a curriculum that impedes this. However, how much is considered too much? Placing an emphasis for students to challenge the assertions of others can promote critical thinking, deeper understanding and competition. Too much emphasis on it can impede the process of learning and foster unhealthy competition between the students and the teachers, which, as implied by the topic statement, could affect social harmony adversely.\\n\\nOn the other hand, students should practice moderation in challenging the assertions of their peers and teachers. Established facts and information that are provided in educational institutions are the product of the discoveries made by our forefathers, which have been tested and proven at one time. A student should learn the basic tenets of academic disciplines before challenging and questioning unnecessarily. How can the student debate the complex ideas and proven theories if the student does not even have the basic knowledge of the subject matter? Also, it is undeniable that the ability and compromise and work with others is an important aspect in the process of learning. The synergy of teamwork is beneficial to a conducive learning atmosphere. As the saying goes, \u201cTwo heads are better than one.\u201d If too much time is spent on debating and questioning , no work would get done, ill feelings would be fostered and as a result no progress would be made. Therefore, schools should make a healthy balance of debate and compromise as a major goal.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I do not believe that the ability to achieve social harmony should be the major goal of all schools. Schools should seek to promote a fine balance between encouraging their students to challenge assertions and their ability to compromise and work together."},{"id":"experts-newbie","metadata":{"permalink":"/experts-newbie","source":"@site/blog/2020-12-15-experts-newbie.md","title":"Advancements in a field of study and outside experts","description":"Questioning and challenging the assertions of others","date":"2020-12-14T18:30:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 14, 2020","tags":[{"label":"conformity","permalink":"/tags/conformity"},{"label":"students","permalink":"/tags/students"},{"label":"learning","permalink":"/tags/learning"},{"label":"essay","permalink":"/tags/essay"},{"label":"gre","permalink":"/tags/gre"},{"label":"awa","permalink":"/tags/awa"}],"readingTime":2.125,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Palash Shrivastava","title":"Not a writer, Ssshhh!","url":"https://github.com/battleofplassey","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35087196?v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"experts-newbie","title":"Advancements in a field of study and outside experts","author":"Palash Shrivastava","author_title":"Not a writer, Ssshhh!","author_url":"https://github.com/battleofplassey","author_image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35087196?v=4","tags":["conformity","students","learning","essay","gre","awa"],"keywords":["students","conformity","essay","gre","awa"],"draft":false,"description":"Questioning and challenging the assertions of others","image":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35087196?v=4","date":"2020-12-14T18:30:00.000Z"},"prevItem":{"title":"Should students challenge the assertions of others?","permalink":"/challenge-assertion"},"nextItem":{"title":"Indicator of a great nation","permalink":"/great-nation"}},"content":"I strongly agree with the assertion that significant advances in knowledge require expertise from various fields. The world around us presents a seamless web of physical and anthropocentric forces, which interact in ways that can be understood only in the context of a variety of disciplines. \x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nTwo examples that aptly illustrate this point involve the fields of cultural anthropology and astronomy. Consider how a cultural anthropologist\'s knowledge about an ancient civilization is enhanced not only by the expertise of the archeologist-who unearths the evidence-but ultimately by the expertise of biochemists, geologists, linguists, and even astronomers. By analyzing the hair, nails, blood, and bones of mummified bodies, biochemists and forensic scientists can determine the life expectancy, general wellbeing, and common causes of death of the population. These experts can also ensure the proper preservation of evidence found at the archeological site. A geologist can help identify the source and age of the materials used for tools, weapons, and structures thereby enabling the anthropologist to extrapolate about the civilization\'s economy, trades and work habits, lifestyles, extent of travel and mobility, and so forth. Linguists are needed to interpret hieroglyphics and extrapolate from found fragments of writings. And an astronomer can help explain the layout of an ancient city as well as the design, structure and position of monuments, tombs, and temples-since ancients often looked to the stars for guidance in building cities and structures.\\n\\nAn even more striking example of how expertise in diverse fields is needed to advance knowledge involves the area of astronomy and space exploration. Significant advancements in our knowledge of the solar system and the universe require increasingly keen tools for observation and measurement. Telescope technology and the measurement of celestial distances, masses, volumes, and so forth, are the domain of astrophysicists.These advances also require increasingly sophisticated means of exploration. Manned and unmanned exploratory probes are designed by mechanical, electrical, and computer engineers. And to build and enable these technologies requires the acumen and savvy of business leaders, managers, and politicians. Even diplomats might play a role-insofar as major space projects require international cooperative efforts among the world\'s scientists and governments. And ultimately it is our philosophers whose expertise helps provide meaning to what we learn about our universe.\\n\\nIn sum, no area of intellectual inquiry operates in a vacuum. Because the sciences are inextricably related, to advance our knowledge in any one area we must understand the interplay among them all. Moreover, it is our non-scientists who make possible the science, and who bring meaning to what we learn from it."},{"id":"great-nation","metadata":{"permalink":"/great-nation","source":"@site/blog/2020-10-01-great-nation.md","title":"Indicator of a great nation","description":"How do you define a Great nation","date":"2020-09-30T18:30:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 30, 2020","tags":[{"label":"nation","permalink":"/tags/nation"},{"label":"essay","permalink":"/tags/essay"},{"label":"gre","permalink":"/tags/gre"},{"label":"awa","permalink":"/tags/awa"}],"readingTime":3.335,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Palash Shrivastava","title":"Not a writer, Ssshhh!","url":"https://github.com/battleofplassey","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35087196?v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"great-nation","title":"Indicator of a great nation","author":"Palash Shrivastava","author_title":"Not a writer, Ssshhh!","author_url":"https://github.com/battleofplassey","author_image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35087196?v=4","tags":["nation","essay","gre","awa"],"keywords":["indicator of a great nation","essay","gre","awa"],"draft":false,"description":"How do you define a Great nation","hide_table_of_contents":false,"image":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35087196?v=4","date":"2020-09-30T18:30:00.000Z"},"prevItem":{"title":"Advancements in a field of study and outside experts","permalink":"/experts-newbie"}},"content":"A nation is a feeling of collective belonging to an identity by its resident which has common language, culture, race, religion or territory. \x3c!--truncate--\x3eA nation is the culmination of a long past of endeavors, sacrifice and devotion of its great heroes, leaders, scientists, artists and most importantly its general public. The author\u2019s point that the indicator of any great nation is represented by the achievements in general welfare of society and not by the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists is true to some extent. However I believe that the achievements of a nation\'s rulers, artists and scientists are synonymous to the general welfare of the people, instead of being separate as implied above.\\n\\nHow do you define a Great nation?  To have common glories in the past, to have a common will in the present, to have performed great deeds together, to wish to perform still more, these are the essential conditions of a being a Great Nation.  A nation is therefore a large-scale solidarity, its existence is a daily plebiscite, and the existence of nations is a good thing, a necessity even. The real indicators of a great Nation could be its Quality of Life, Human Rights Development Index, Happiness Index, GDP, political freedom, personal safety, education systems, public health care, and high standards of living.\\n\\nAs an illustration, let us look at two very different countries: Switzerland and Myanmar. Switzerland has been ranked among one of the countries that provide the highest standards of living in the world, which is inclusive of an efficient health care system and free education for all their citizens. Their success is reflected in their social, political and economic stability. On the other hand, Myanmar is a complete opposite representation of Switzerland. A country that has been backed by a harsh autocratic military regime for years, the citizens of Myanmar have long been oppressed and denied of many basic human rights. Even though the country is rich with natural resources, the people do not enjoy any of the wealth that comes with it. Instead they live in poor and squalid conditions. These conditions, on top of their lack of political freedom have led to many social uprising, which has most recently culminated into the public demonstrations by the monks in Yangon. By using the example of these two countries, it is fair to say that the general welfare of a nation\'s people is the surest indicator of a great/successful nation.\\n\\nConsider the case in India. It has an enormous population and it achieved independence less than a century ago. A general overview of the welfare of its people will bring out the low average income, food scarcity and low literacy levels. These are all true but situations improve over time. It has one of the best educated people in the world and a highly modern telecommunication infrastructure. In this particular case, we should also look closely at the contributions of individuals from various fields. Ramanujan, an unorthodox mathematician, put India into the map of modern mathematics. Nobel Prize winner C.V. Raman\u2019s contributions to physics displayed the technical prowess of India. Satyajit Ray won the lifetime achievement Oscar award for his excellence in cinema. Father of the Nation and Bharat Ratna, Mahatma Gandhi was one of the strongest freedom movement activist the world produced. There are plenty of examples to show that India is a great nation, not by virtue of the state of the people, but due to the outstanding contributions made by pioneers within the country. Hence, in certain cases, the achievements of rulers, artists or scientists can speak for the greatness of a nation.\\n\\nAs a conclusion, A nation that provides well for its people has the potential for a nation to grow into greatness; it promotes a conducive ground for political, economic and social growth. The achievements of a nation\'s rulers, artists and scientists are important indicators of a great nation as well but their achievements are tied to the general welfare of the society."}]}')}}]);
