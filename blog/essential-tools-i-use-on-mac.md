Here are some essential Mac OS apps.

<!--truncate-->

### 1. Maccy

[Maccy](https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy) is a lightweight clipboard manager for macOS and lifesaver tool for me. It keeps the history of what you copy and lets you quickly navigate, search, and use previous clipboard contents.

### 2. Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is **The Missing Package Manager for macOS** as it helps install [the stuff you need](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ "List of Homebrew packages") that Apple didn’t provide. After installing Homebrew you can simply install a number of softwares in one go with a single command like below.

```bash
brew install --cask firefox chrome postman dbeaver
```

So No more “To install, drag this icon…”.

### 3. OneMenu

[OneMenu](https://www.withmarko.com/one-menu) is a menu-bar app which has a keyboard cleaning mode. I use this mode to disable key presses while I physically wipe my keyboard. Additionally it also features a system monitoring tool and a window manager.
